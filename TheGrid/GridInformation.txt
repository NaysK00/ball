Created with Blender 2.76b on 1/MARCH/2016.
Grid was inspired by Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter V by CAPCOM.

Each mipmap in GridGrey.dds was handmade.
Before exporting to other formats, the mesh was triangulated with Quad Method: Fixed/Polygon Method: Beauty, but the original .BLEND file is still not triangulated.
The .dae file was exported with Include UV Textures/Include Material Textures enabled. With the rest of the formats, the default export settings were used.
When importing into Blender, remember to increase the clipping range since the scenery is large (N > Clip > End > 100000.0).
